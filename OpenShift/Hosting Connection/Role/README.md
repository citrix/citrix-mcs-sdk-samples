# OpenShift Roles with Minimum Permissions for CVAD Operations.

This document provides tools to help you create and assign minimum-permission roles for Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops (CVAD) operations on OpenShift, reducing security risks and manual errors.


<br> 

## 1. Overview

The OpenShift plugin uses a Service Account to perform CVAD operations such as power management and machine catalog creation. 

Granting excessive permissions (e.g., Cluster Admin) increases security risks, so itâ€™s important to assign only the permissions required for CVAD tasks.

Manually defining and assigning these roles can be time-consuming and error-prone. This document offers scripts to automate the process.

## 2. Solution: A PowerShell Script with Role Definitions.


### Key Features

- Automates creation of roles with minimum required permissions for CVAD operations.
- Automates assignment of these roles to a specified Service Account.


### Role Definitions

The following YAML files define the required roles:

- **cvad-watcher-clusterview.yaml**  
  *Cluster-wide role to watch events, VMs, networks, etc.*

- **cvad-power-management.yaml**  
  *Namespace-scoped role to manage the power states of existing VMs.*

- **cvad-machine-creation.yaml**  
  *Namespace-scoped role to support MCS functionalities such as provisioning VMs.*



### Role Assignment Script

Use the `AssignRoles.ps1` script to create and assign the roles. The script requires:

- `ServerUrl`: The OpenShift API server address (e.g., `https://api.myOpenshift.myDomain.local:6443`)
- `Username`: OpenShift console username (e.g., `kubeadmin`)
- `ServiceAccount`: The target service account (e.g., `sa-citrix`)
- `ServiceAccountNamespace`: Namespace of the service account
- `TargetNamespace`: Namespace where resources will be managed (e.g., VM creation)



**Example usage:**

```powershell
./AssignRoles.ps1 `
    -ServerUrl "https://api.myOpenshift.myDomain.local:6443" `
    -Username "kubeadmin" `
    -ServiceAccount "sa-citrix" `
    -ServiceAccountNamespace "citrix" `
    -TargetNamespace "citrix"
```

You will be prompted for the user password during execution.
